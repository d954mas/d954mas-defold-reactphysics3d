# ReactPhysics3D for Defold

ReactPhysics3D lua bindings for the Defold Game Engine.

This project based on [ReactPhysics3D](https://github.com/DanielChappuis/reactphysics3d)(zlib license)

ReactPhysics3D is an open source C++ physics engine library that can be used in 3D simulations and games.

I tried to keep the lua api the same as the c++ api when possible.

If you like the extension you can support me on patreon.
It will help me make more libraries for defold.
